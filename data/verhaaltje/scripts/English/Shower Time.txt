With Slurfy it’s different. 
Surfy loves to be hosed.:)  
He has made a very special shower. Precisely because he likes water so much. :D 
He’s got a little watering can that he hung over a branch. And Tommy can pull. Psssssjt! -Amused-
Great, Slurfy thinks. I love a summer shower. :D

Oh, All these crazy animals. :O 
Donkey Longear had disguised himself as a zebra because it was carnival. -haha- 
But now the paint stripes won’t come off his body. :’(
I will spray you, longear, says the elephant. -boos- 
And I will spray you untill you become just a normal little donkey. 

Wolf David does his afternoon walk. :) 
Suddenly he stands still before a window. He is shocked by what he sees. :O
Crookednose, the parrot, is combing his crest; -:D. 
After he is done he sprays water on his plumes. xD 
David doesn’t know that crookednose is busy copying his mistress. :)
