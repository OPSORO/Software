In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf.
One Sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop! Out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar.
He started to look for some food.
On Monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry.
On Tuesday he ate through 2 pears but he was still hungry.
On Wednesday he ate through 3 plumbs but he was still hungry
On Thursday he ate through 4 strawberries but he was still hungry
On Friday he ate through 5 oranges but he was still hungry
On Saturday he ate through 1 piece of chocolate cake, 1 ice cream cone, 1 pickle, 1 slice of cheese and one slice of salami. That night the caterpillar had a bad stomach
The next day was Sunday again. The caterpillar ate through 1 green leaf and after that he felt much better.
Now he wasn’t hungry anymore and he wasn’t a little caterpillar anymore, he was a big caterpillar
He built a small house, made a cocoon around himself. He stayed inside the cocoon for 2 weeks.
Then he made a hole into the cocoon, pushed his way out and he was a beautiful butterfly.
